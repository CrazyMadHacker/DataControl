DataControl
=====================

Take control over your online presence the free way.

Where it all starts
=====================
You know those pesky little terms and conditions and privacy policies they bother you with everytime you want to download an app or sign up for an app or website no one reads? Well those are the start of what data is collected, how its used and what they can do with it. Companies love to have vague confusing terms so here are three sites that will help.

https://privacyspy.org/ - Grade and Monitor popular services<BR>
https://tosdr.org/ - Grades based on protecting consumer rights and data privacy<BR>
<DETAILS>
<SUMMARY>There maybe be multiple policies for their different products but make sure it matches your expectations.</SUMMARY>

* What type of information does the site collect?
     - Email might be collected when you sign up and address makes sense if you are having food delivered but is there a clear reason why camera, microphone and exact location and IP need to be collected?
* How does it collect this information?
     - Certain tracking technologies are a red flag, they will gather more data than is nesscary.
* Who has access?
     - Data transfer to 3rd parties, advertising partners, affiliates are other companies getting access to your data. You want the policy to give you a specific list of companies
* What are your optinos?
     - Receiving ads even after opting out, no guarantee information can be deleted, governement access to user data are a few of the options that are actually not options.
* Security Measures?
     - Basic encryption should be mentioned with protocols, shouldn't be vague like we secure your data 100%. 
* How long will it store?
     - There should be a data retention policy and data sanitizing.

  Start taking your data back
  =====================
  
Review Current Accounts Privacy Policy<br>
Restrict access in privacy settings<br>
Opt out of data collecting<br>
Change Providers or close accounts<br>

  Go through all your accounts privacy settings as well as their privacy policy to restric access, opt out of any data collecting you can and if their privacy policy has too many red flags, find another provider. If you must keep a certain proivider or social media account, think twice before you post. Your images you post and content you share can quickly become the property of that site to sell or resuse if their privacy policy includes: 
  > as royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license or  nonexclusive, irrevocable, worldwide, perpetual, unlimited, assignable, sublicenseable, fully paid up and royalty-free right to us to copy, prepare derivative works of, improve, distribute, publish, remove, retain, add, process, analyze, use and commercialize, in any way now known or in the future discovered, any information you provide.

Cloud storage that doesn't have zero knowledge encryption can unlock your files and depending what is in their privacy policy they can scan and review everything as needed.<br>
Companies can also changes their terms whenever they want as long as they inform thier customers about the changes, so don't ignore those policy change emails!


To skirt around lawsuits from them being extra arbitration clauses have been added which takes your right to take the company to court and having group complaints from multiple users, opt out of arbitration clauses.



Web Scraping
  =====================

Adjust privacy settings (google, facebook, twitter, youtube, reddit, instagram) delete any stored data and turn off tracking on web and app activity, location history, YouTube history, and ad personalization.

Avoid filling in surverys, this is the number one place for data.

Mobile apps can collect data even when you are not using them so make sure to go through all the permissions and make sure only what you are using is installed and the permissions your phone gives those apps makes sense. Temu does not need to know your IP, contact list or calendar information to order and ship a product.

Privacy
  =====================
Not All VPN's are created equally. Some companies are also mandated to surrender user data to law enforcement so make sure you have a VPN that does not log/keep your data, or at least doesn't sell your data. Using one email for your accounts and devices are easier to connect and make a user profile so use separate email addresses for important stuff and have a throw away.

Use Privacy focused services like browsers and search engines. Not Google.

Clean up 
  =====================
1) Delete/deactivate and have your data removed from all accounts you no longer use. If you do not have a password manager that collects these logins, check your browser password manager as well as google password manager to see if anything was saved. Also go through old emails for any welcome emails.
2) Remove unnecessary apps and edit permissions on apps being used
3) Cancel Loyalty programs, they are known to sell your data.
5) Clean up, delete or change to a high security email provider
6) Optimize smart device privacy settings
7) Opt out of marketing assosciations<br>

=====================
  https://www.optery.com/ - They have a free report to get started on other sites.<br>
  There are lists every where for data brokers, CA and VA have recently made data brokers reveal themselves and also keep a list.

Taking It One Step Further
=====================
Unique complex passwords for every account, use a password manager, don't reuse passwords<br>
Enable MFA for ALL accounts. When I can, I use a yubico hardware MFA.<br>
Dark Web Scan, I like to keep on top of any data that might be out there and change emails/ credit cards before something happens<br>
