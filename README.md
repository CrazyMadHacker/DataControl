You know those perky little terms and conditions and privacy policies they bother you with everytime you want to download an app or sign up for an app or website no one reads? Well those are the start of what data is collected, how its used and what they can do with it.

There maybe be multiple policies for their different products but make sure it matches your expectations.

What type of information does the site collect?
  Email might be collected when you sign up and address makes sense if you are having food delivered but is there a clear reason why camera, microphone and exact location and IP need to be collected?
How does it collect this information?
  Certain tracking technoloiges are a red flag, they will gather more data than is nesscary.
Who has access?

What are your optinos?
  Receveing ads even after opting out, no guarentee information can be deleted, governement access to user data,
Security Measures?
  BAsic encryption should be mentioned, shouldn't be vague 
How long will it store?

Cloud storage that doesn't have zero knowledge encryption can unlock your files and depending what is in their privacy policy they can scan and review everything as needed.
Companies can also changes their terms whenever they want as long as they inform thier customers about the changes.
Your images you post and content you share can quickly become the property of that site to sell or resuse in any way they want.

To skirt around lawsuits from them being extra arbitaion clauses have been added which takes your right to take the company to court and having group complaints freom multipl.e users.

Not All VPN's are created equially. Some companies are also mandated to surrender user data to law enforcement sd make sure you have a VPN that does not log/keep your data. Using one email for your accounts and devices are easier to connect and make a user profile.

Clean up 
1) Delete/deactivate and have your data removed from all accounts you no longer use. If you do not have a password manager that collects these logins, check your browser password manager as well as google password manager to see if anything was saved. Also go through old emails for any welcome emails.
