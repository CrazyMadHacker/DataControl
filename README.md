Special Circumstances If you’re a victim of violent crime or identity theft, it’s often possible to opt out of information that others can’t opt out of. You may, however, need to provide court orders or other information. It may be worth checking more complete data broker lists which include those: https://www.privacyrights.org/data-brokers

Preventing Identity Theft & Opting Out of Marketing Sites:

Consider freezing your credit, which prevents creditors from accessing your credit report. (It also prevents credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name, but you will receive a pin to unfreeze your credit, if needed.) You will need to provide personal information such as your name, address, date of birth, and social security number to freeze your credit. While you can sometimes initiate this online, it’s better to do it by phone. Fees for freezing your credit vary by state. To freeze your credit, contact:

Equifax: 1 (800) 349-9960, https://www.freeze.equifax.com/
Experian: 1 (888) 397‑3742, https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/credit-education/preventing-fraud/security-freeze/
TransUnion: 1 (888) 909-8872, https://www.transunion.com/credit-freeze/place-credit-freeze
Innovis: 1 (800) 540-2505, https://www.innovis.com/personal/securityFreeze
